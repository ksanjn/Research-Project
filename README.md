# 24-25J-113 Research-Project

As an overview, the aim of this research project is to try and identify the various software engineering jobs that are at risk of getting automated by AI and suggesting better jobs that are at less risk of getting automated while providing necessary help to bridge the knowledge gap between the jobs.

The main idea is broken down to four specific components as,

 - Identifying the current software engineering tasks that are replaced by AI and tasks that could be replaced in future by AI.
 - Identifying alternative software engineering jobs with tasks similar to the user's current tasks that are less likely to be automated by AI.
 - Assessing the current skillset of the user and identifying the skills that the user is lacking that is needed for the new suggested role.
 - Identifying the user preferences and recommending the best suited pathways to achieving the new skills.
